# Shield Server
This is a node.js web application that creates shields ( https://github.com/olivierlacan/shields )  to solve this issue: https://github.com/olivierlacan/shields/issues/15?source=c .

It uses the shielded library ( https://github.com/cainus/shielded ).

It runs on heroku out-of-the-box, but can easily run elsewhere.
